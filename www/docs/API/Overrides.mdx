# Overrides (Exposed Methods to Override)

DragSelect exposes some internal methods that are available to overide. It is not recommended to use them unless you know what you are doing. Please use [Methods](Methods) or [Events](Events) instead wherever possible!

For a concrete example on how to use the overrides see [CustomSelectionFilter](/docs/guided-examples/CustomSelectionFilter).

## Selection
| method | properties | returns | usage |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
| `Selection.filterSelected` | {<br/>select: Map<DSElement, DSBoundingRect>,<br/>unselect: Map<DSElement, DSBoundingRect>,<br/>selectorRect: DSBoundingRect<br/>} | {<br/>select: Map<DSElement, DSBoundingRect>,<br/>unselect: Map<DSElement, DSBoundingRect><br/>} | Can be overridden to apply further filtering logic after the items to select are identified but before they actually get selected. Is expected to return the select / unselect maps in the same shape as passed in

## Example

```js
const ds = new DragSelect({});
ds.Selection.filterSelected = (obj) => {
  // do something here
  console.log('filterSelected', obj)
  // return what needs to be returned
  return obj
}
```
